<h1 style="text-align: center">Foundry Graphics</h1>

Foundry Graphics is an imagined business for a freelance graphic designer. Here users will be able to browse the previous works of the artist and be able to commission their own peices with an estimate of how much that would cost them. With the benefit of having a rough cost the potential client will be able to make an informed decision on whether the artist is within their budget. For the artist this will give them a much more streamlined way of giving estimates for work without the need for as much bargaining and back and forth before securing interest in their product.
