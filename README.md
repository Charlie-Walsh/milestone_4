<h1 style="text-align: center">Foundry Graphics</h1>

Foundry Graphics is an imagined business for a freelance graphic designer. Here users will be able to browse the previous works of the artist and be able to commission their own peices with an estimate of how much that would cost them. With the benefit of having a rough cost the potential client will be able to make an informed decision on whether the artist is within their budget. For the artist this will give them a much more streamlined way of giving estimates for work without the need for as much bargaining and back and forth before securing interest in their product.

# User Experience (UX)

## User Stories

### Home

* The landing page will be easy to navigate and give the user the option to browse the artist's work or get an estimate, consisting of two images with buttons, or act as buttons themselves. A small intorduction to the business and some customer feedback will also be present as well as the login/sign up functionality.

* For both first time visitors and returning ones it will be easy to locate where they want to go on the site. First time users will be able to browse freely but will be asked to sign up to get a quote.


### Gallery

* The gallery will serve as both a portfolio of the artist's work as well as a shop. If there is a design the user likes they will be able to purchase it at different canvas sizes or in a digital format. However an account will be required in order to make a purchase.

### Commission

* Commissioning a piece will be done through a request form, selecting size and type as well as a description of what they had in mind for the image.

* This will be emailed to the owner and any adjustments to the estimate can be made by contacting the customer directly.

### Payment

* Payment will be be simple and secure and will need an account for delivery purposes. A basket area will also be needed if customers are going to be purchasing more than one item.

## Design

* Typography
    - I will be using Michroma for the company logo and Prompt for the main bulk of the text as it is nice and clean, and I would like the overall feel of the project to be sleek and professional.

* Color Pallette
    - This will be white, or slightly off white depending on how harsh the contrast ends up being with a dark grey for the logo and text. This will allow the artists work to pop with colour and not have the surroundings detract or distract from what the user should be focused on. The exception to this rule will be on the nav bar where the log in/sign up will be located.

* Images
    - As this is an imagined business I will be uses images from open source resources.
